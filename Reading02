# What is jQuery?
**jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.**

**The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.**

**jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.**

**jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.**

### The jQuery library contains the following features:

* HTML/DOM manipulation
* CSS manipulation
* HTML event methods
* Effects and animations
* AJAX
* Utilities

*you can use the mwthods of jQuery object to update the element that it contains. 


## Why jQuery?
**There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.**

### Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:

* Google
* Microsoft
* IBM
* Netflix

**jQuey use ##### feature detection to find the best way to achieve task.**

The ability to update all of the elements in the jQuery selection is knowne as implicit iteration.



**With jQuery, when a selector returns multiple elements, you can update all of them using the one method. There is no need to
use a loop.**


**The process of placing several methods in the same selector is referred to as chaining. As you can see, it results in code that is
far more compact.**

**The • htm 1 () and • text () methods both retrieve and update the content of elements. This page will focus on how to retrieve element content.**

**If you use the at tr() method to update an attribute that does not exist, it will create the attribute and give it the specified value.
The value of the cl ass attribute can hold more than one class name (each separated by a space). The addCl ass() and removeCl ass() methods are
very powerful because they let you add or remove an individual class name within the value of the cl ass attribute (and they do not affect any other class
names).**

* The . css () method lets you retrieve and set the values of CSS properties.
* To get the value of a CSS property, you indicate which property you want to retrieve in parentheses. If the matched set
contains more than one element, it will return the value from the first element.
* To set the va lues of a CSS property, you specify the property name as the first argument in the parentheses, then a comma, followed by its
value as the second argument.
This will update every element in the matched set. You can also specify multiple properties in the same method using object literal
notation.

* jQuery allows you to recreate the functionality of a loop on a selection of elements, using the • each () method.
* The • on () method is used to handle all events. Behind the scenes, jQuery handles all of the cross-browser issues you saw in the last chapter.

**The position of <scri pt> elements can affect how quickly a web page seems to load.**
**If your page is slow to load and you only want to include a small amount of code before the rest of the page has loaded, you can
place a <script> tag within the body of the page**

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming:

## Concept: Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the “driver”, the other, 
also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the “navigator”;it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so.

### Expected Benefits
* increased code quality: “programming out loud” leads to clearer articulation of the complexities and hidden details in coding tasks, reducing the risk of error or going down blind alleys
* better diffusion of knowledge among the team, in particular when a developer unfamiliar with a component is pairing with one who knows it much better
* better transfer of skills, as junior developers pick up micro-techniques or broader skills from more experienced team members
* large reduction in coordination efforts, since there are N/2 pairs to coordinate instead of N individual developers
* improved resiliency of a pair to interruptions, compared to an individual developer: when one member of the pair must attend to an external prompt, the other can remains focused on the task and can assist in regaining focus afterwards

#### Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually 
deliver a product. Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job,
with one less hurdle to overcome.
