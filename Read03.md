##  Mustache.js with Node and Express

**The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.**


##### Mustache
* Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code â€” anything. It works by 
expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

#### Mustache-Express
**If you intend you use mustache with Node and Express, you can use mustache-express. Mustache Express lets you use Mustache
and Express together easily.**

**The mustacheExpress method can take three parameters: the directory of the partials, the extension of the partials, and an optional 
array of tags. When a partial is requested by a template,the file will be loaded from path.resolve(directory, partialName + extension).
By default,these values are determined by Express.**

## Flexbox 

**Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:**

* Block, for sections in a webpage
* Inline, for text
* Table, for two-dimensional table data
* Positioned, for explicit position of an element
* The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning

**To start using the Flexbox model, you need to first define a flex container.**
**The flex container becomes flexible by setting the display property to flex**
**The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.**

##### The flex-flow Property
* The flex-flow property is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

**The align-content property is used to align the flex lines.**
**The direct child elements of a flex container automatically becomes flexible (flex) items.**
**The align-self property specifies the alignment for the selected item inside the flexible container.**
**The align-self property overrides the default alignment set by the container's align-items property.**

#### Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid
layout is intended for larger scale layouts.
